      "body": "Git development began in April 2005, after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management (SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the project since 2002. Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers. Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important. Packages are only split when compelling advantages exist, such as to save disk space in particularly bad cases of waste.
